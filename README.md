# Git user and repository fetcher
This is a project in which user details and its repositories are fetched using GitHub Api.

`no need to import install anything just clone this repo and open index file`

# Point to remember:
As I am using free version of Api, it allows us to send only 60 requests per hour for Each IP address.
